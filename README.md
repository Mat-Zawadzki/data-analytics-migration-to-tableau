# Data Analytics Migration Tableau
- Used Pandas to ingest 10 years of flight data containing millions of records each and integrated that data together <br>
- Cleaned the data using various techniques to remove unwanted or incomplete data and saved the output in an integrated CSV file <br>
- Used PostgreSQL on AWS RDS to store the cleaned and transformed data in order to enable data analysis <br>
- Integrated Tableau with the PostgreSQL RDS to visually explore the data and to create visualisations and various real-time charts (bubble, pie, bar and line) using the back-end flights data stored in RDS <br>
- Prepared a presentation to share with top management highlighting the insights and findings observed <br>
